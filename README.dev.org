* terminology

 - Use "duration" when describing how long (in microseconds or seconds) a
   tone will last. Don't use length when speaking about how long (in
   microseconds or seconds) a tone will last.
 - Use "sound" when referring to sound devices, sounds systems
   (ALSA/PulseAudio, etc.) or sound outputs (sinks). Don't use "audio" in
   this context.
 - Use "inter-mark-space" when referring to space between Dots and Dashes
   within one character.  Don't use "end-of-mark space".
 - Use "inter-character-space" when referring to space between characters
   within one word. Don't use "end-of-character space".
 - Use "inter-word-space" when referring to space between words. Don't use
   "end-of-word space".

* Sound systems

** Console

*** FreeBSD

**** beep
Text visible after installing 'beep' package on FreeBSD 12.1:

For PC spearker sound to work you need to be in the operator group and need rw/ permissions to /dev/speaker device.

Load kernel module:
kldload speaker

Add a user to operator group:
pw groupmod operator -m jerry

Uncomment the following lines in /etc/devfs.rules file:
# Allow members of group operator to cat things to the speaker
[speaker=10]
add path 'speaker' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules add the following to /etc/rc.conf:
devfs_speaker_ruleset="speaker"

Then restart devfs to load the new rules:
/etc/rc.d/devfs restart


** ALSA

To kill pulseaudio server and prevent it from re-starting:
emacs ~/.config/pulse/client.conf
autospawn = no
killall -9 pulseaudio
