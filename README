This is README file for unixcw project version 3.6.0.

unixcw is a project providing libcw library and a set of programs
using the library: cw, cwgen, cwcp and xcwcp. The programs are
intended for people who want to learn receiving and sending Morse
code. unixcw is developed and tested primarily on GNU/Linux system.

The heart of the unixcw package is libcw library.  It offers the
following basic CW services to a caller program:

 - Morse code character translation tables, and lookup functions
 - Morse code low-level timing calculations
 - A 'sidetone' generation and queueing system, using either the system sound
   card or the console speaker
 - Optional keying control for an external device, say a transmitter, or an
   oscillator
 - CW character and string send routines, tied in with the character lookup
 - CW receive routines, also tied in to the character lookup
 - Adaptive speed tracking of received CW
 - An iambic keyer, with both Curtis 8044 types A and B timing
 - Straight key emulation





The library uses signals and threads to create a background task in
which it performs the majority of its work, leaving the main program
free to handle other tasks.  For example, the simplest CW sending
program that uses the library looks like this (compile it with
"gcc -lcw example.c"):


#include <libcw.h>

int main(void)
{
        /* Library initialization */
        cw_generator_new(CW_AUDIO_SOUNDCARD, NULL);
        cw_generator_start();

        /* Start the string sending in the background. */
        cw_send_string("Hello, world");

        /* Wait for the string send to complete. */
        cw_wait_for_tone_queue();

        /* Library cleanup */
        cw_generator_stop();
        cw_generator_delete();

        return 0;
}


Instead of the cw_wait_for_tone_queue() call, this program could
instead handle any other work it has to do, asynchronously from the CW
library's sending.

As well as the handful of applications included in unixcw, the
following types of programs might also use libcw as their core:

 - a fully graphical CW send and receive station
 - a 'CWbiff' that announces incoming email sender in CW
 - an offline CW reader program, capable of decoding CW from MP3 or
   other sound file formats
 - a simple Iambic keyer for an external transmitter, using the mouse
   buttons as the keyer paddles
 - a more comprehensive CW tutor program
 - an automated Morse Code testing application

libcw is written in C for easy portability and use.





In addition to libcw, the package comes with four basic applications:

 - cw: a CW sending 'engine' that reads characters from stdin, sounds
   them on either the sound card or the console speaker, and echoes
   them to stdout.

 - cwgen: a simple random character generator that can be used as a
   feed for cw.  For example:

               cwgen | cw

 - cwcp: a curses-based program that generates groups of characters
   from selected sets, words, and CW abbreviations randomly, and
   sounds them using libcw.  It owes much to CP222.EXE, by VU2ZAP.

 - xcwcp: a CW tutor program for X Window environment.  It offers the
   same random and keyboard sending as 'cwcp', and in addition can
   read CW that sent to it using the keyboard or mouse as a keyer,
   making it useful for sending as well as receiving practice.

Primary development platform for unixcw is Debian GNU/Linux. An effort has
been made to compile and test this version of unixcw package (or at least
parts of this package) on following platforms:

Debian GNU/Linux 9, x86_64, gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516
Alpine Linux 3.12, x86_64, gcc (Alpine 9.3.0) 9.3.0
Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS, x86_64, gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0
FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE-p6 amd64, gcc (FreeBSD Ports Collection) 9.3.0




unixcw is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL license, version 2 or
later.  See COPYING for details.

unixcw is written in C and C++.

unixcw can be built and installed with standard set of commands:
    ./configure && make && make install

Depending on platform and software/files installed on build machine,
build system will configure and compile following features:
 - support for console buzzer in libcw;
 - support for OSS sound system in libcw;
 - support for ALSA sound system in libcw;
 - support for PulseAudio sound system in libcw;
If a support for a feature from this list is available in libcw, it
will be available in rest of applications from unixcw package.

Moreover, depending on platform and software/files installed on build
machine, the build system will configure and compile following
features:
 - cwcp, if ncurses development files are available;
 - xcwcp, if QT5 development files are available (xcwcp is an
   application written in C++);

libcw library, and cw and cwgen applications are built
unconditionally.

You can explicitly disable some libcw and unixcw features by passing
flags to configure script. See output of "./configure --help" for
details.

Check your platform-dependent documentation on what packages/files are
needed for each of these features.





Build-time requirements for unixcw:
 - standard build environment to build software from source package
   with "./configure && make && make install";
 - GNU make may be necessary on some platforms (I've had a problem
   with FreeBSD's make on FreeBSD 9.3; make on FreeBSD 10.0 worked
   fine).  If, when running "make", you see an error message like
   this:
           *** Parse error in unixcw-3.4.0/src: Need an operator in '../Makefile.inc' (Makefile:640)
           *** Error 1 in unixcw-3.4.0 (Makefile:416 'all-recursive')
   then install gmake package, and try running "gmake & gmake install"
   instead of "make & make install".
 - pkg-config to get configuration flags for QT5 application (xcwcp);
   you can override pkg-config settings for QT5 using environment
   variables, see output of "./configure --help" for details.
 - sound system library development files for including support for
   OSS, ALSA and PulseAudio sound sinks in libcw;
 - header file providing KIOCSOUND symbol for including support for
   console buzzer in libcw.
 - ncurses development files for building cwcp;
 - QT5 development files for building xcwcp;





unixcw 3.4.2 (or at least parts of it) was successfully compiled on
following platforms:
 - Debian GNU/Linux 8 jessie/sid, x86_64, gcc 4.9.2;
 - Alpine Linux 3.1, x86_64, gcc 4.8.3, musl 1.1.5;
 - FreeBSD 10.0, x86_64, clang 3.3;

unixcw 3.4.1 (or at least parts of it) was successfully compiled on
following platforms:
 - Debian GNU/Linux jessie/sid, x86_64, gcc 4.9.1;

unixcw 3.4.0 (or at least parts of it) was successfully compiled on
following platforms:
 - Debian GNU/Linux jessie/sid, x86_64, gcc 4.9.1;
 - FreeBSD 10.0 (x86_64-unknown-freebsd10.0, with clang 3.3);
 - FreeBSD 9.3 (freebsd9.3 with gcc 4.2.1);
 - OpenBSD 5.5 (amd64-unknown-openbsd5.5 with gcc 4.2.1);
   compilation on OpenBSD gives lots of warnings related to usage of
   functions deemed unsafe by OpenBSD developers, but there are no
   errors. There are also some warnings about redeclarations of some
   functions - this still needs to be fixed.
