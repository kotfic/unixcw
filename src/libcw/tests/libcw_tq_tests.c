/**
   \brief Create and initialize tone queue for tests of capacity

   Create new tone queue for tests using three given parameters: \p
   capacity, \p high_water_mark, \p head_shift. The function is used
   to create a new tone queue in tests of "capacity" parameter of a
   tone queue.

   First two function parameters are rather boring. What is
   interesting is the third parameter: \p head_shift.

   In general the behaviour of tone queue (a circular list) should be
   independent of initial position of queue's head (i.e. from which
   position in the queue we start adding new elements to the queue).

   By initializing the queue with different initial positions of head
   pointer, we can test this assertion about irrelevance of initial
   head position.

   The "initialize" word may be misleading. The function does not
   enqueue any tones, it just initializes (resets) every slot in queue
   to non-random value.

   Returned pointer is owned by caller.
