   \brief Receiver. Receive a series of marks and spaces. Interpret
   them as characters.


   There are two ways of feeding marks and spaces to receiver.

   First of them is to notify receiver about "begin of mark" and "end
   of mark" events. Receiver then tries to figure out how long a mark
   or space is, what type of mark (dot/dash) or space (inter-mark,
   inter-character, inter-word) it is, and when a full character has
   been received.

   This is done with cw_rec_mark_begin() and cw_rec_mark_end()
   functions.

   The second method is to inform receiver not about start and stop of
   marks (dots/dashes), but about full marks themselves.  This is done
   with cw_rec_add_mark(): a function that is one level of abstraction
   above functions from first method.


   Currently there is only one method of passing received data
   (characters) from receiver to client code. This is done by client
   code cyclically polling the receiver with
   cw_rec_poll_representation() or cw_rec_poll_character() (which
   itself is built on top of cw_rec_poll_representation()).


   Duration (length) of marks, spaces and few other things is in
   microseconds [us], unless specified otherwise.
