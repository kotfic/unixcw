Description: Morse code tutor - shared library
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.
 .
 This package provides shared library files to handle Morse code
 signals and to generate sound on the console buzzer or a sound card
 through OSS, ALSA or PulseAudio.

Package: libcw7-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any

Breaks: unixcw-dev, libcw3-dev
Description: Morse code tutor - development files
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.
 .
 This package provides the static library, headers, and manual page for
 development of programs that handle (i.e. send and receive) Morse code.

Package: cw
Architecture: any
Depends: libcw7, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf|debconf-2.0
Description: Morse code tutor - command line user interface
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse.
 .
 This package provides two executables:
  * cw - a simple command line application that converts key-presses
    to Morse code that can be heard through the console buzzer or a
    sound card;
  * cwgen - a program that generates groups of random characters for
    Morse code practice, which can be piped to the cw program.
 .
 It also includes example files (with the extension "cw") containing
 commands which can be used to change properties such as the speed,
 tone, and spacing of characters.

Package: cwcp
Architecture: any
Depends: libcw7, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf|debconf-2.0
Description: Morse code tutor - text user interface
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.
 .
 This package provides an interactive Morse code tutor with a
 full-screen text-based (ncurses) user interface. It offers menu
 selection of sending modes, and keyboard control of character
 sounding options such as the sending speed and pitch.

Package: xcwcp
Architecture: any
Depends: libcw7, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf|debconf-2.0
Description: Morse code tutor - graphical user interface
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.
 .
 This package provides an interactive Morse code tutor with a Qt4
 user interface. It allows choosing from a number of options for
 practice, including sending random characters, random words, and
 characters from the keyboard. It will also receive Morse code sent
 using the keyboard or mouse as a Morse keyer, and display the
 characters it sees.
